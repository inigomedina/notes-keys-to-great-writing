If I could teach only one key to great writing, it would be this: Make every word count.

Recognize the power of a single, well-chosen word. Trust it to do its work. As a rule, the more economically you use language, the more powerfully you will deliver your message.

Of course economy of language is only one characteristic of an accomplished style. Other factors, such as colorful word choice and specific detail, also play a part.

Whenever we can say in one word what it took us six words to say in our first draft (as we saw in editing the title from “What Life Is Like in Harlem” to “Harlem”), we have probably improved our copy.

“Style takes its final shape more from attitudes of mind than from principles of composition.”


Keep in mind that these techniques are meant to guide you in your editing, not in your drafting. In fact, when you are creating your text—when you are trying to find the words that capture your thoughts and hoping to build momentum—don’t give these principles and techniques a thought. Just let the words fly, knowing you will come back later and edit meticulously, even ruthlessly. 

Both Mark Twain and Ernest Hemingway cautioned writers against the careless use of modifiers. The challenge in eliminating redundant modifiers, however, is that familiarity breeds complacence. The more frequently we hear and read certain word combinations, the more acceptable they begin to sound and the more likely we are to use them unthinkingly—not because they are the best, most natural, and concise way to say what we have to say, but simply because they sound familiar.

Isn’t that a true fact? (A true fact?) The end result—a phrase as redundant as a new initiative—is wordy writing.



When a word implies its category, don’t write both the word and the category. For instance, round in shape, heavy in weight, and pink in color are redundant because we know that round is a shape, heavy is a weight, and pink is a color.



The third type of redundancy, redundant pairing, has a long tradition in English.

- any and all
- basic and fundamental
- each and every
- few and far between
- first and foremost
- full and complete
- hope and desire
- one and only
- over and done with
- peace and quiet
- precious and few
- true and accurate
- various and sundry
- and so on and so forth


4. Replace wordy expressions with single words.

Here is a longer list of common wordy expressions to watch for when editing:

8. Avoid protracted introductions.
Sometimes we place undue emphasis on relatively unimportant matters before we get to the heart of what we are saying. As many writers of fiction know, the first few sentences of a draft, or even the first few paragraphs or pages, often turn out to be expendable. The story, they discover when revising, doesn’t really begin until later. What at first seemed essential was merely a warm-up for the writer, not something engaging to the reader. By all means, do your warm-up exercises if they help you loosen up and get things under way, but delete them from your final copy.

The following phrases or clauses usually can be eliminated or shortened:

Change this	To this
First of all,

First, (or delete)

The first point I want to make is

First, (or delete)

The first thing that needs to be said is

First, (or delete)

What I want to do next is

Next,

In the final analysis,

Finally, (or delete)

Last of all,

Finally, (or delete)

Last but not least,

Finally, (or delete)

After all is said and done,

(Delete)

In my opinion,

(Consider deleting)

To be honest,

(Consider deleting)

To tell the truth,

(Consider deleting)

In all candor,

(Consider deleting)

Needless to say,

(Delete)

For all intents and purposes,

(Delete)

Obviously,

(Consider deleting)

Of course,

(Consider deleting)

Insofar as … is concerned,

Regarding,

As for,

For

In fact,

(Delete, unless you are elaborating a point)

As a matter of fact,

(Delete)


Many sentences beginning with it is can be recast by using a noun or pronoun as the subject and changing the following adjective or noun to an active verb. Other it is constructions can be shortened or simply eliminated.

Change this	To this

I (We) understand that (or delete)

It is my opinion that

I think that (or delete)

It is my belief that

I believe that (or delete)

It is my (our) recommendation that

In any event, you should use there constructions carefully because they often waste the reader’s time.

Change this	To this
There are many accomplished writers who use there constructions in their descriptions.

There are many well-known politicians who are planning to attend.

There are three supervisors who are causing all the problems.

Three supervisors are causing all the problems.

There is a demand for correct spelling on the part of readers.

Similarly, what constructions, so common in speech, should be used sparingly in writing.

Change this	To this
What I want to do next is

Next,

What you will find on your first day is

On your first day you will find

What she really wants is recognition.

Above all, she wants to be recognized.
